#### This repo consists of basic data science based solutions and visualization to problems.

##### analysis_visualization_1 : 
###### This repo consists of ```sample.csv``` dataset as an example and visualization using dash is done. Also, provides comparisons with different algorithms, the code to the same can be found [here](https://github.com/Praveenk8051/data-science/tree/master/visualizations/analysis_visualization_1)


##### analysis_visualization_2 : 
###### This repo consists of ```sample.csv``` dataset as an example. Also, provides comparisons with different algorithms with scraped data, the code to the same can be found [here](https://github.com/Praveenk8051/data-science/tree/master/visualizations/analysis_visualization_2)
